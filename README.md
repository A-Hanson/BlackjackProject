### Topics and Technologies Used
<ul>
    <li>Test Driven Development - I wrote J-Unit tests for the functionality expected out of my BlackjackHand methods.

Examples included how the toString was outputting and if the getHandValue was totalling the cards correctly.</li>
    <li>Object Oriented Programming
        <ul>
            <li>Abstract Classes - The Hand class </li>
            <li>Inheritance - For </li>
            <li>Enum Data Type - For the Ranks and Suits of the card, I used Enum data types. This allowed me to use constants while building the Card and Deck classes.</li>
        </ul>
